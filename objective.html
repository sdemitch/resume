                    <p class="careerobj">What I search for in a career is something that allows me to stretch my creative muscles. I absolutely love the problem solving aspect of coding, the process of figuring
                        something out is one of my favorites. However, what motivates me to push beyond my limits is if I am given creative liberty to execute the project however I desire. While interning at 
                        Public Interest Registry, I was tasked with creating a web app to keep track of the internal inventory. I was given complete creative freedom to design the site in any way I wanted. Upon 
                        showing my coworkers what I had created at the end of the internship, they loved it so much that I was hired part-time just so they could ensure that I would work for them after college. I want 
                        to create things that are useful, creative, and fun. My objective is to create easily accessible web apps and websites, to reduce the disparity between those with technological skills, and those without.
